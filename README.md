# Outline
Start with structure. End with brilliance.

> “Outline is ?a framework, ?a ui library... I am curous to know from you. Please explore... If you are developer with no time... then it is for you. But don't expect too much.”

## Why Outline?

Because sometimes you just want:

- A button that looks good out of the box
- A grid system that doesn’t fight you
- A theme that doesn’t require a PhD
- A UI kit that respects your time

## What’s Inside?

- ✅ Core components (Button, Modal, Input, Grid, etc.)
- ✅ Layout primitives (Stack, Box, Flex)
- ✅ Theming system (lightweight, token-based)
- ✅ Utility hooks (useToggle, useTheme, etc.)

## What’s Not?

- ❌ No routing
- ❌ No state management
- ❌ No visual builder
- ❌ No marketing fluff

Outline is your UI sketchpad. Use it, bend it, break it. Just don’t expect it to do your job for you.
